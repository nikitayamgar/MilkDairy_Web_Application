<p>
The proposed project is one of the ways towards a complete cashless process to collect fines/penalties from offenders through e-Challans and provides information about traffic rules
In Major cities, on an average about 10 to 20 lakh cases are annually booked by Traffic Police. Till now fines were collected in cash from the offenders for which the traffic personnel would issue a manually written receipt. The fines collected would then be deposited in the state treasury. With the introduction of e-Challans, cash transactions have completely eliminated collection of fines by the Traffic Police. By all standards e-Challans is the most transparent, accountable and convenient system.
As cash transactions have been completely eliminated, motorists could pay the fines through credit and debit card.
